Important Notes for Windows:
   - Start your X server (VcXsrv/X410) BEFORE running this script
   - In VcXsrv: disable "Native opengl" and enable "Disable access control"
   - If GUI doesn't appear, check Windows Firewall settings
   - Docker Desktop must be running

TIPS

# Step 5: Start the container
echo ""
echo "Starting Turtlesim container..."
echo "   If successful, you should see a window with a turtle!"
echo ""

docker compose up turtlesim

echo ""
echo "Done! The turtle window should appear in your X server."
